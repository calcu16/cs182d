\section{Data Analysis Methods}

To analyze the data we made a content log for each interview.
The content log was a written record of when the student started answering each question,
 and timestamps of significant events so that we could easily find interesting portions of the video.
We also kept records of what we thought was interesting about the interview. \\

When planning the interview questions, we had already thought about the strategies students could use to solve the questions.
For instance we laid out the functions in Question 1 such that we could differentiate between the student evaluating in execution order, following the numbers of the function names, starting with simple functions, and going from top down or bottom up.
We noticed students switching strategies between problems in our interviews, which we then decided to analyze. \\

We transcribed several sections of the interview, which was too much data to present in this paper.
The sections of transcripts presented in this paper best illustrate our findings.
In particular, the student we present most clearly shows his confusion, and resolves it in the most clear manner.
This allows us to look at the effects of a given strategy on the problem the student used it on.
