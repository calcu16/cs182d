\section{Data Analysis Methods}

To analyze the data we made a content log for each interview.
The content log was a written record of when the student started answering each question,
 and timestamps of significant events so that we could easily find interesting portions of the video.
We also kept records of what we thought was interesting about the interview. \\

When planning the interview questions, we had already thought about the strategies students could use to solve the questions.
For instance, Question 1 has the execution order, numbers of the function names,
 and layout of the functions on the page all in different orders so we can differentiate between those strategies.
We noticed students switching strategies between problems in our interviews, which we then decided to analyze. \\

We transcribed several sections, which was too much data to present in this paper.
The sections of transcripts presented in this paper best illustrate our findings.
In particular, the student we present most clearly shows his confusion, and resolves it in the most clear manner.
