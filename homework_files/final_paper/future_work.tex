\section{Future Work}

For future work, we believe more qualitative research needs to be done to classify viable strategies for these two types of problems. 
Additionally, we would like to have a list of factors that may affect which strategy students choose for these problems. 
Creating lists of both strategies and factors could be done in a study where a wider variety of problems are given with changing factors such as length and complexity of code. 
\\

To follow the qualitative work, some quantitative research could occur. 
In particular, we would like to be able to quantify when strategies work well. 
We could learn if an optimal strategy exists for certain problems by requiring interviewees to use certain strategies even though they might choose another on their own. 
Lastly, we could quantify how the factors in each problem affect which strategy is chosen by the student.
