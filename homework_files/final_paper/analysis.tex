\subsection{Overview of Claims \& Introduction to Analysis}

We will show that a student used different strategies to decide which order to look at functions between two problems.
For an evaluation problem, the student evaluated the code in the order it would have been executed.
For a debugging problem, the student started looking at the code at the top of the paper and continued down until reaching a likely candidate for the location of the bug.
For this student, each strategy appear to help him understand unfamiliar constructs, which then allows him to solve the problem. 
We include two partial transcripts from a debugging and an evaluation problem to back these claims. 
The student whom we have transcribed has taken a couple of computer science classes at Harvey Mudd College, including Principles and Practices of Computer Science, Data Structures and Program Development, and has tutored extensively for the Data Structures and Program Development class.

\section{Q1}
% First sentence
% main
He begins by identifying the call to main.

``Alright so, its got a main, so thats gonna start. [...]''\\

The student starts at the main function, it is the very first thing he identifies.
He continues evaluating the code in execution order.
This student's evaluating strategy clearly is identify where execution starts and then continue in execution order.

The student continues in execution order until he hits func2,
% func2

The student tries to evaluate func4 instead of passing it to func1.

``Function 2 returns function 1 with the same two arguments already passed to it, and function 4, the result of -''

He immediately jumps to ``the result of,'' even there are no parenthesis that are required for function calls.
Clearly he is unfamiliar with passing functions as arguments in Python.

The student tries to resolve his confusion by looking at func4
% func4

He tries to find ways to call func4, without any arguments,

``Which doesn't have any implied arguments, thats interesting. Umm, thats odd [pause]''

In this case he is working off of the hypothesis that if you have default arguments to a function,
  then you can call the function parenthesis.
However, the student notes that there are no default arguments (he refers to them as implied arguments).
Note, that even though the program does not call func4 from func2, from the student's perspective, because he believes func4 needs to be called, func4 was next in execution order.

He continues onto func1, even though he is confused about how func4 works in func2.
% func1

He notes that the \texttt{f} in func1 is the same as func4 in func2.
\begin{tabular}{lp{13cm}}
6& lets see, so its calling functi-,ooh, it calling function 1.\\
7&There we go. Uhh, yes, so its calling function with a list a number, the array and 4,\\
8&and the function 4 as sort of a multiplier.\\
9&A function to apply. \\
\end{tabular}\\
The student is able to figure that func4 is being passed as an argument.
He note that function 4 is being used as a multiplier, and the succinctly describes it as a function to apply.
He clearly now understands that functions can be passed as arguments, and the semantics of doing so.
The student drew this conclusion by continuing with execution order, and matching up the f in function 1 with the func4 in function 2.
It appears that following execution order helped him figure this out, he might not have been able to make that connection if he had not looked at function 1 while being confused about the need for func4.
However since he was already primed to call a function he was able to identify that the argument f got called.


\subsection{Play-by-Play}
\subsubsection{Q1}
\begin{tabular}{lp{13cm}}
1& Alright so, its got a main, so that gonna start. [...]\\
\end{tabular}\\
The student is going to start with the main function, which gets called at the bottom of the script. \\
Omitted is the transcript of the student continuing to follow the execution until the time he reaches function 2. \\ \\
\begin{tabular}{lp{13cm}}
2& Function 2 returns function 1 with the same two arguments already passed to it,\\
3&and function 4, the result of - \\
\end{tabular}\\
The student is evaluating function 2.
He notes that there is function 4, and he tries to determine what the resulting value should be. \\ \\
\begin{tabular}{lp{13cm}}
4&Which doesn't have any implied arguments, thats interesting. Umm, \\
5& thats, odd [pause] \\
\end{tabular}\\
The student is looking for implied arguments to function 4. \\ \\
\begin{tabular}{lp{13cm}}
6& lets see, so its calling functi-,ooh, it calling function 1.\\
7&There we go. Uhh, yes, so its calling function with a list a number, the array and 4,\\
8&and the function 4 as sort of a multiplier.\\
9&A function to apply. \\
\end{tabular}\\
The student continues to function 1 and notices how the argument is being used.
He then deduces the correct semantics for the function call in function 2. \\

\subsubsection{Q4}
\begin{tabular}{lp{13cm}}
1& Alright so we have a board class which is gonna presumably represent the connect 4 board [...]\\
\end{tabular} \\
The student relates the board class to the game described in the problem statement. \\ \\
\begin{tabular}{lp{13cm}}
2& it's going to create an array of arrays or a list of lists depending on what you call it in python [...] \\
3& i don't know if, if lists in python are dynamically allocated or not [...] \\
4& so i wonder what this is doing. I guess it would be creating - an array with at least six - er, seven secondary arrays in it [...]\\
\end{tabular}\\
The student mentions multiple possibilities for the data structure of the board member. \\ \\
\begin{tabular}{lp{13cm}}
5& so drop, i guess that is where you drop a piece in - if column less than self.width um self.board.append player \\
6&oh ok so its doing  [starts drawing on paper] like a - array of arrays essentially and then it just pops on a color [...] as they happen [...] \\
\end{tabular}\\
The student figures out what the board data structure looks like and how it changes. \\ \\
\begin{tabular}{lp{13cm}}
7&so this is where you would need to do the check [points at drop function with pen] \\
\end{tabular} \\
The student says the drop function is where the bug could be fixed.



\subsection{Interpretation}
All line numbers in the following paragraphs refer to line numbers in the transcript of the corresponding problem. \\

The student is evaluating in execution order in Q1.
The student is unfamiliar with the semantics of passing a function as an argument in Python.
Initially, as demonstrated on line 3 of Q1, he tries to call the function which led to confusion since there were no arguments. On line 4 of Q1, he looks for implied arguments, further evidence that he is trying to call this function.
However, by continuing in execution order to function 1,he is able to notice how the argument he had tried to call earlier is now being used as a function to apply, as stated in line 9 of Q1.  \\

The student is debugging by reading from top down, stopping upon encountering a likely solution, in Q4.
Upon reaching the creation of the board data member, the student's lack of experience with Python causes him to be confused about how the physical representation of a connect four board maps onto this data member.
As he continues reading top down, the Python list functions used in the drop function help him determine which of the possibilities (previously enumerated on line 3 of Q4) were true for the board data member.
This helped him map the physical representation onto the data member.
This knowledge helps him fix the bug which had been given to him in relation to the physical connect four board.  \\

The student used two different strategies in the debugging and evaluation question.
These strategies helped him move past an unfamiliar concept each time. 
In other interviews, if the student did not move directly from function 2 to function 1 in Q1, it took much longer to connect function 4 passed as an argument as the applied function in function 1.
In Q4, some other strategies we have seen have led the student to get stuck in other locations as they try to relate the code to the physical model. 





%The right method can help a student move past concepts they are not familiar with. While evaluating, a student used execution order which helped him understand a concept, and switching to top down let him ignore a large portion of the code and clear up some misunderstandings.


\subsection{Summary}
We have shown that a student used different strategies to decide which order to look at functions between two problems.
For the evaluation problem, the student evaluated the code in the order it would have been executed. 
In the process, he was initially stumped by the code passing a function as an argument, but realized what was happening by continuing to follow the path of execution. 
For the debugging problem, the student started looking at the code at the top of the paper and continued down until reaching a likely candidate for the location of the bug. 
As he debugged, he was initially unsure about the data structure used as the board data member, but as he continued down, he was able to find code that supported one of the possibilities he had enumerated earlier.
For this student, each strategy appeared to help him understand unfamiliar constructs, allowing him to solve the problems.
