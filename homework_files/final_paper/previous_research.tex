There have been other research related to this study.
Some studies covered code evaluation and debugging strategies in a narrow range of programs,
 and concluded that the individual problem did not have an effect on strategy.
They also discuss some weaknesses of our study, for instance our students only had access to the code on paper, limiting more interactive debugging and web searches.
Additionally our code samples were relatively short compared to what might be found in industry,
 longer code samples might display different behavior.

Mosemann and Wiedenbeck investigate code comprehension by novices with respect to navigation method \cite{mosemann2001}.
They gave students two different programs to evaluate and a navigation method to use, either sequential, data flow, or control flow.
The students were evaluated by asking a series of yes/no questions about the program.
Mosemann and Wiedenbeck, found no interaction between program and navigation method.
However we suggest that with more diverse problems and methods there may be some interaction, but the study was not broad enough to discover them.

Fitzgerald, et al. investigated debugging methods among novices \cite{fitzgerald2008}.
They confirm that students often used a tracing strategy on a variety of different debugging problems.
Their results show that the bugs in their study were relatively easy to fix, and that determining how programmers discover where a bug is located is more useful.
Our study found similar results, and so we focus on discovering the location of a bug rather than fixing it.
However, they note an increased reliance on online resources for debugging, something that we did not provide.
Some student strategies exhibited that we could not possibly replicate in our study are using println statements and tracing using a debugger.

Rajlich and Wilde talk about concepts both as code formations, such as passing a function, and domain knowledge, such as dropping a game piece into a board \cite{1021348}.
From a series of case studies, they argue that experts do not understand the entirety of the code they are debugging but simply map their domain knowledge on to code concepts to narrow down the code areas they must look at.
This mapping of domain knowledge to code occurred in interview ACBE3 as the student connected functions within the code to actions taken in a connect four game.
These mappings allowed the student to focus only on a single function instead of understanding the entire program.

Through qualitative interviews, Mayrhauser and Vans noticed that often program comprehension involves multiple ways of thinking about the code \cite{402076}.
In addition to explaining a number of them, how often they were used, and how they believe they work together, they perform a study and provide results of how often each of the strategies was used by a programmer looking for a section of code within a 40000 line program in a two hour period of time.
While most of our interviews were far too short for our subjects to have the time to switch between different strategies, we did occasionally see strategies changing, and this paper provides information about what might occur if our problems and interviews had been longer.

These papers are relevant to our work because they cover various studies about code debugging, evaluation, and the strategies used in either case. Our work builds on these papers by comparing debugging and evaluation strategies directly instead of treating them as separate topics.
