\section{Abstract}
We performed a qualitative analysis on a small study asking questions about code evaluation and questions about debugging.
The code samples included programming concepts or syntax unfamiliar to the students.
We saw different strategies such as following order of execution or reading code from the top of the file down. Strategies often changed from question to question, and some appeared more suited to different questions.
We believe evaluating these strategies is important because a programmer's choice of strategy can affect their success or failure in maintaining, changing, or interacting with code written by others.
