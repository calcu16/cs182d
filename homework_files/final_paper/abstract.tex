\section{Abstract}
We performed a qualitative analysis on a small set of interviews asking questions about code evaluation and questions about debugging.
The code samples included programming concepts or syntax that was unfamiliar to the students we interviewed.
We saw different strategies such as following the order of execution and reading code from the top of the file down. Students' strategies often changed from question to question, some strategies appeared more suited to different questions, and some strategies helped students understand the unfamiliar concepts.
We believe evaluating these strategies is important because a programmer's choice of strategy can affect programmers' success or failure in maintaining, changing, or interacting with code written by others.
