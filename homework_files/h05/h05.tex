\subsection{Post Interview Reflection (Joint)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Syntax error - immediately said was never on the line the error gives
  \item Should have asked people about their previous experiences such as grutoring, which could make a huge difference in looking at code
  \item Huge variety of skill levels we have been getting
  \item Much better at finding the problem without understanding everything else than previous participants
  \item Got both of the bugs in Ruby and continued, but stopped immediately after finding bug in python
  \item debugging problems, resorted to top down (except when given an error with line number)
  \item for the first two, really didn't need to write on paper to keep track of what was going on
  \item was thrown off by list syntax in python where code enclosed in brackets means different things in different places
\end{itemize}
