\section{Interview: ACBE1}
\subsection{Post Interview Reflection}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hard to tell when participant is asking questions we should answer.
  \item Did first two questions prime participant too much to completely understand the code instead of trying to fix specific problem?
  \item Always started from a top of file
  \item When functions were small, would skip around if a function was called, but not as much skipping around when looking at larger functions.
  \item Got lost in code, think forgot what initial question was - we want to provide printed question to participant in future interviews in order to try and make sure they remember what they are doing
  \item Often when confused, didn't have a specific question that we could answer without leading too much
  \item Ruby question actually worked well because we knew more when we should step in and explain a ruby question because participant hadn't seen ruby before
  \item Occasionally missed pieces of the code (eg. a plus sign between two function calls)
  \item Got bogged down in functions that didn't matter to question - wanted to understand code fully which we believe contributed to forgetting initial question in 2.2
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Interview Summary}
Interview length: 49:20m \\
Technical difficulties: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Table is reflective
  \item Paper was missing a new page mark, so two questions had strange paper size
  \item Double equals doesn't have a break in the middle because of the font
\end{itemize}
We went through Questions 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, and 2.2.

\section{Interview: ACBE2}
\subsection{Post Interview Reflection}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Went through first two problems very efficiently
  \item In 2.1, figured out problem with tomorrow and how to fix it, and what the problem with yesterday was, but not how to fix yesterday until prompted
  \item Much less thrown off by ruby than previous participant
  \item Could infer some syntax correctly (inferred some incorrectly) but was still able to work with the code without being told that her assumptions about syntax were incorrect/correct
  \item backtraced on the smaller functions, skipped str function but not score in 2.2
  \item didn't backtrace on 2.2 even though there was code that would backtrace similarly to the first two problems
  \item needed to understand whole class, not just specific functions within it
  \item first question was put off by passing functions but recovered quickly
  \item like previous participant, replaced function calls with results but only in comprehension
  \item relied on names a lot in second two questions
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Interview Summary}
Interview length: 36:25m \\
Technical difficulties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Camera setting were slightly different, but recording came out fine
\end{itemize}
We went through Questions 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, and 2.2.
