Title: \\  A Qualitative Analysis of Comprehension and Debugging Strategies \\ \\
Presenters: \\ Andrew Carter and Beryl Egerter \\ \\
Abstract: \\
We performed a qualitative analysis on a study consisting of four interviews of college students with varying amounts of experience beyond basic programming. In the interviews, we asked the students to perform code comprehension or debugging on four or five code samples with varying levels of difficulty. Some code samples included programming concepts or syntax unfamiliar to the students. We are interested in the different strategies the students used for exploring unfamiliar code and have qualitatively analyzed how well they worked on our code samples. Strategies we saw included students delving into the details of a function or obtaining a high level summary of a function from the name. Some students even changed strategies depending on the given task. We believe evaluating these strategies is important because the strategies can affect the success or failure of programmers trying to maintain, change, or interact with code written by others. These situations often occur in industry. Furthermore, differences in strategy may affect research methodology depending on problem type and complexity.
